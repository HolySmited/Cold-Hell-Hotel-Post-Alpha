# Cold-Hell-Hotel-Post-Alpha
Post-Alpha Cold Hell Hotel official repo

There's an online remote repository that is the official repo for a project. No one ever interacts with this directly.
Each member of the team will begin by cloning this repo onto their local machine using the GitHub Desktop application. 
This does not create a branch, this simply adds an offline working copy of the repo to your computer. From here, please
create a new branch. This is your personal copy of the master repo to do whatever you want in. You then open this 
in Unity and work on whatever it is you want to work on. Once you're done, open the desktop application again. You should see a
list of changed files and an option to comment. Comment with whatever it was that you added, changed, or removed. Make sure
your branch is active and click the Sync button. This will push from your local machine repo to the remote repo for your branch. If
the changes need to be added to the official copy of the game, create a pull request from your branch to the master branch. Again,
comment it with whatever your additions, changes, or removals were. Once you make the request, the master admin will review it. If
approved, it will be merged with the master remote branch and the official game copy will update to your version.
