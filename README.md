Setup (THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE IF YOU HAVE NO WORKING PROJECT ON YOUR MACHINE)
1. In a browser, navigate to the repository
2. Click the dropdown menu to select a branch and create a new branch with the name "FirstInitial_LastName" (mine would be M_Wilson)
3. This branch will be the only area you work on; no one should be working on the raw master branch
2. Download the GitHub Desktop Application
//WIP 

Setup (USE THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A WORKING PROJECT BUT HAVE NOT ACCESSED THE REPO BEFORE)
1. Follow all of the original setup instructions
2. Find your local branch repo in the File Explorer
3. Delete everything from that folder

4. Click the commit button

1. Once you've updated your branch, click the Pull Request button (top right)
2. Make sure it is set to "from (your branch) into master"
